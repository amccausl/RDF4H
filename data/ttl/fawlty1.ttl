    <http://bbc.co.uk/ns#additionalDetail> "It' not until Polly takes up the milk jug that the alarm is raised. Basil is alarmed as he suspects the kippers may be responsible. They all rush up the stairs to investigate (NB set rocks) Basil's only concern is to hide the \"evidence\". After frantic attempts to dispose of the kippers by trying to throw them out of the window, Polly manages to persuade Basil that Mr Leeman has been dead for hours - so the kippers can't be to blame. A jubilant Basil turns around to see that Dr Price has entered with a puzzled look as to why Basil is so happy to have a dead guest & why he has a couple of kippers sticking out of his jumper! Basil & Sybil decide to move the body into the office until the undertakers come & collect it.", "Mr Leeman accepts Sybil's offer of kippers for breakfast. Day breaks & in the dining room Mrs Chase is giving Manuel the runaround, fussing over her beloved dog who gets the sausages Dr Price wanted. She is obnoxious to Manuel & Polly & the dog bites both of them. Polly gets her revenge by putt- ing hot sauce on the sausages before giving them to the dog. Meanwhile in the kitchen Basil expresses concern re the use-by date on the kippers he is about to take up to Mr Leeman. Terry the chef says there's no cause for concern. Basil enters Mr Leeman's room complaining to the silent guest re the latest car strike & the state of the country, Basil fails to notice the reason Mr Leeman doesn't respond - he is dead! Basil thinks he's rude", "The Whites demand they open the cupboard, Basil pretends he doesn't have the key, but Manuel insists he has it in his pocket! They eventually let Miss Tibbs out & Basil warns her not to hide in guests cupboards, claiming she does it all the time. One of Mr Leeman's arms slip out of the cupboard, Basil doesn't notice so Polly trys to let him know in a subtle way e.g. \"He doesn't mean any hARM\" etc. When Basil realises what Polly means he & Manuel create a diversion that involves Manuel doing a flamenco dance. Once they get rid of the Whites they bring Mr Leeman down to the office, the Major sees him but fails to grasp the situation. Dr Price is still waiting for his sausages & Miss Tibbs appears at reception looking for Basil to have a row with.", "The sign o/s hotel reads 'Fatty Owls'. In the hotel bar the Major asks a guest, Mrs Chase, what breed her fussed-over little dog is, she answers \"He's a little Shih Tsu\"! He replies is he really? Oh dear.\"! Another guest, Dr Price, arrives at the bar, he says he is starving & would like some sausages, Sybil apologises & explains the kitchen is closed, so he settles for a ham sandwich. Basil's innate snobbery kicks in & he fawns embarrassingly over him. A guest, Mr Leeman, walks in accompanied by a few friends who soon depart promising to meet up wth him in the morning. It is apparent that he is feeling ill, Sybil is sympathetic but Basil thinks Mr Leeman is ignoring him & takes a dislike to him & is rude when he requests breakfast in bed.", "Their attempts to keep the corpse a secret fail. Whilst Polly & Basil move the corpse out of the room, Miss Tibbs, guest, wanders in & screams after the laundry used to conceal it falls off. Despite attempts to silence her, she is still hysterical so Polly has to slap her & unfortunately knocks her out, Basil remarks \"Oh spiffing, absolutely spiffing, 2 dead, only another 25 to go\". They rush Miss Tibbs & Mr Leeman into nearest room, but unfortunately the occupants of the room, the Whites, want to go in to collect their things. Polly has to stall them whilst Basil & Manuel hide the body & Miss Tibbs in the cupboard in the guest's room. They let the White's in but moaning can be heard from the cupboard as Miss Tibbs comes round from the slap.", "They realise they are not the undertakers so Basil leaves Sybil to explain. Basil, Manuel & Polly take corpse upstairs & into a room where they happen upon a guest blowing up a blow-up doll! They rush downstairs wth the body but Manuel has had enough & wants to quit, so climbs into the laundry basket leaving Basil standing in the lobby wth dead body just as Mr Leeman's friends are coming out of the office having been told re their friend's death. Basil has Mr Leeman propped up against the hat stand & by now all the guests are assembled in the lobby, Basil tells Sybil to give them all an explanation whilst Basil dives into the laundry basket, where he is last seen being loaded onto laundry truck & driven away! Sybil is left calling \"Basil\"", "Unfortunately Miss Tibbs wanders into the office & sees body & faints.  Basil & Manuel take the corpse into the kitchen & put him on a table just as Dr Price walks in & sees them & warns them they can't keep a dead body in the kitchen.

Basil says sorry about the injuries & hopes they'll all be able to get together again when Sybil's better.  At this point, real Sybil walks in as the stunned guests look on, Basil pretends she's Sybil's lookalike from town, introduces himself & guides her into the kitchen past Terry & Manuel who are fighting on the floor & locks her in a cupboard.  He returns to his speechless guests to whom he says farewell as they depart through the door.  Polly runs downstairs & he says \"Piece of cake! Now comes the tricky bit!\". He head toward the kitchen & the programme closes.", "Basil answers bedroom door to Manuel who complains chef Terry is obstructing him mkng paella, Basil says \"go away!\"  Basil's friends come upstairs & stand outside Sybil's bedroom door; Basil gets 1 of them an ashtray from downstairs & stops to swig bottle of wine, & ends up pouring it over his own head after being interrupted by Manuel who says Terry's spoiling his Paella. Basil rtns to his guests with peanuts & crisps, & tries to stall them for Polly to dis- guise herself. He ends up tipping bowl of peanuts on floor & runs away to get brush & pan.  Downstairs, he bodily picks up a complaining Manuel & shouts: \"I'm not interested!\" & hurls him into the kitchen. He continues to divert his guests with small talk & intros them to long time guest the Major.", "Basil guides guests into dark bedroom, there is much confusion & they fall over each other, & guest Reg twists his ankle.

He decides to say she's ill. He takes his friends into the bar for a drink; and tries to put off first Alice & then another couple who arrive with a cake from seeing Sybil. He builds up a tissue of lies as he tells them she's in bed asleep,has swollen face & has lost her voice. Basil digs himself in even deeper & says doctor has been & it cld be serious.  A third couple arrive & say they've seen Sybil in town & Basil hastily says it's a woman who looks like her. The guests commiserate, but insist on popping upstairs to say hello to Sybil.  Basil drags protesting Polly upstairs & insists she disguise herself as Sybil; she agrees in exchange for money to buy her car.", "Sign outside hotel reads \"Flowery Twats\" (anagram of Fawlty Towers) Polly complains to chef Terry in the kitchen, that Basil is reluctant give money promised her to buy car; waiter Manuel enters & says he's going to make a Paella.
